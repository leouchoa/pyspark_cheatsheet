# pyspark_cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for `pyspark`

# Create and Active the Environment

For environment creation and package orchestration I'm using conda. To install the environment and further activate it, please run:

```
conda create -f environment.yml
conda activate pyspark_test
```



## About the dataset used

The dataset was taken from the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and I added some `NAs`. 


Further I want to extend this guide in AWS by using [this really big dataset](https://github.com/beanumber/airlines) to show how to setup clusters.
