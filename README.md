My cheatsheet for pyspark

# Create and Environment

For environment create and package orchestration I'm using conda. To installthe environment and further activate it, please run:

```
conda create -f environment.yml
conda activate pyspark_test
```



## About the dataset used

The dataset was taken from the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). 


Further I want to extend this guide in AWS by using [this one](https://github.com/beanumber/airlines).
